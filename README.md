# CafeConnect

CafeConnect is your go-to platform for discovering restaurants with essential amenities, catering to digital nomads, students, and anyone seeking a place to get wifi access, use restroom, or charge their phone. An important feature is a database of restaurants in the Chinatown, San Francisco area on the front page, with key information displayed. It will also have a form to let users add information about new restaurants in the area, and a form to let users update those key attributes (wifi, power outlet, restroom) for existing restaurants in the database.
